        "Ans = An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, essentially acting as a middle ground to exchange data and functionality; a real-life example is when you use a weather app on your phone - the app uses a weather service's API to retrieve current weather data and display it on your screen"

        "Ans = Advantages of using APIs: APIs enable seamless integration between different systems, allowing applications to communicate and share data efficiently. They automate tasks and workflows, improving operational efficiency. By leveraging third-party APIs, developers can accelerate development, avoiding the need to build complex functionalities from scratch. APIs promote modularity, reusability, and platform independence, enabling systems on different technologies to work together. APIs also provide access to real-time data, ensuring that applications remain up-to-date.\n",
        "\n",
        "Disadvantages of using APIs: APIs can introduce security risks if not properly secured, leading to vulnerabilities like unauthorized access or data breaches. Relying on third-party APIs creates dependencies, where service disruptions, changes, or discontinuation can affect the application. Additionally, constant maintenance is required to adapt to new API versions. Performance can also be impacted due to network latency or rate-limiting by external services, leading to slower application response times."

        "Ans = REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are two widely used architectures for web services.\n",
        "\n",
        "REST Architecture\n",
        "REST is an architectural style that utilizes standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources identified by URIs. It is resource-oriented and emphasizes stateless communication, meaning each request from the client to the server must contain all the necessary information for processing. REST supports various data formats, with JSON being the most common, making it lightweight and easy to use. Its simplicity allows for easy integration and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "SOAP Architecture\n",
        "SOAP is a protocol that uses XML to structure messages and defines a strict set of rules for message formatting and processing. It operates over various transport protocols, including HTTP and SMTP, and is designed for high security and reliability through standards like WS-Security and WS-ReliableMessaging. SOAP is stateful, allowing for complex transactions and operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Shortcomings of SOAP\n",
        "Complexity: SOAP is more complex than REST due to its rigid standards and protocols, making implementation and maintenance challenging.\n",
        "Performance Overhead: SOAP messages are larger (XML-based), leading to increased bandwidth usage and slower performance compared to REST.\n",
        "Limited Flexibility: SOAP requires strict adherence to its specifications, reducing flexibility in terms of data formats and interaction styles.\n",
        "Slower Development: The detailed requirements for SOAP can result in longer development times compared to the straightforward REST approach."

        "REST generally offers better performance due to lower overhead and lighter data formats, while SOAP can have more significant performance overhead due to its XML-based messaging.\n",
